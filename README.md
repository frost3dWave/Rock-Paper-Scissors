# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## About
A JavaScript project created as part of The Odin Project.
Initially, the game was played through the console, with users typing their responses for each round. 
Later on, I created a UI to make the game more intuitive and fun to play, moving away from typing responses. 
This project allowed me to practice JavaScript concepts like event listeners and DOM manipulation. It served as a good playground to practice these skills.
